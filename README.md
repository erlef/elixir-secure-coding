### Project Todos:
- Lean harder into Elixir-isms for examples / prescriptiveness
- Add more sources to text
  - Superscript sources / citations
  - Potentially add historical examples of compromises deriving from different exploiot types 
- Customize text more (it's rather copy-pasty right now)
- Iterate on / create new examples

### README Todos:
- Secure Elixir Logo
- Screenshots
- Badging (Livebook, License, etc.)
- Quick links at the top linking to sections within the README (Website | Usage | etc.)
- Decouple info from 1-introduction.livemd that's better suited here (acknowledgements, what this is, future modules, etc.)
- How to "install" for Learners
- How to "install" for Educators
- Contributing section / link to CONTRIBUTING.md
